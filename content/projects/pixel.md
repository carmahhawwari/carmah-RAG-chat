# Project
- PIXEL was a 10-week, accelerator-style product exploration of an AI-native design-to-code concept focused on translating design intent into production-adjacent code.

## Role
- Served as product designer and design engineer.
- Defined the product concept, interaction model, and system boundaries.
- Built prototypes and iterated on core flows.
- Collaborated with teammates in a fast-paced, exploratory environment.

## Constraints
- High ambiguity in early-stage product definition.
- Limitations of AI models in preserving layout, hierarchy, and design system intent.
- Balancing creator flexibility with guardrails that maintain trust and usability.
- A fixed 10-week accelerator timeline.

## Decisions
- Scoped the product to translation of design intent rather than full end-to-end build.
- Used constraint-based generation to stabilize layout and hierarchy.
- Added guardrails to prevent output that violated system boundaries.
- Prioritized a small set of core flows to keep iteration tight.

## Outcomes
- Functional prototype demonstrating design-to-code translation.
- Interaction flows for the primary creation and iteration loop.
- System boundary map defining inputs, outputs, and non-goals.

## Learnings
- In this project, preserving design intent required explicit constraints, not just model prompting.
- In PIXEL, over-broad generation reduced trust in the output for production-adjacent use.
- Narrowly scoped flows enabled faster iteration under accelerator timelines.
- System boundaries reduced ambiguity and clarified what the tool would not do.
