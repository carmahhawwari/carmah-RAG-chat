# Project
- Apple Maps on Web Redesign — A product design project over the span of 12 weeks, redesigning Apple Maps' web experience by adapting the Liquid Glass design system.

## Role
- Product designer responsible for end-to-end UI design across desktop and mobile surfaces.
- Focused on translating the Liquid Glass design system to web contexts.
- Collaborated with engineering and product on scoping, bug prioritization, and alignment with the broader Maps ecosystem.
- Designed partner-facing place card experiences for editorial partners such as Michelin, Infatuation, and Golf Digest.

## Constraints
- Adapt a native-first design system (Liquid Glass) to web and extension environments.
- Technical feasibility and web performance limits on interaction patterns.
- Internal quality, accessibility, and consistency standards.
- Constraints surfaced through cross-functional coordination, iterative reviews, and alignment with engineering and product partners.

## Decisions
- Determined which Liquid Glass elements translated to web surfaces versus required adaptation or simplification.
- Aligned design fixes with release timelines through bug prioritization and scoping.

## Outcomes
- Designed partner-facing place card experiences integrating editorial content from Michelin, Infatuation, and Golf Digest into the Maps ecosystem.
- Delivered updated UI components and interaction patterns adapted for web performance, accessibility, and cross-browser requirements.

## Learnings
- Translating a native-first design system to the web requires explicit decisions about what not to carry over, rather than aiming for visual or interaction parity.
- In this project, early attention to web performance and accessibility reduced late-stage revisions that would have undermined system consistency.
- Partner-facing experiences introduce additional constraints around hierarchy, content density, and clarity that differ from first-party UI patterns.
- In this project, close collaboration with engineering and product teams was necessary when design changes intersected with bug triage, release timing, and platform limitations.
