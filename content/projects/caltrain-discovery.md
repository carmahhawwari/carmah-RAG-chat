# Project
- A product design project to reduce friction in place discovery for Caltrain riders, especially in off-peak or exploratory contexts.

## Role
- Defined user journeys and scoped the discovery flow.
- Designed interaction patterns for place discovery.
- Built prototypes to explore and communicate the interaction model.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to align on scope and feasibility.

## Constraints
- Limited attention during transit.
- High discovery friction in off-peak or exploratory scenarios.
- Cognitive load constraints in motion.
- Balancing simplicity with relevance.

## Decisions
- Used card-based results to keep discovery scannable.
- Applied snapping behavior to stabilize interaction during motion.
- Introduced lightweight filters to narrow choices without overload.
- Scoped the flow to focus on discovery rather than full trip planning.
- Chose guided, card-based discovery over list-heavy search to reduce cognitive load during transit.
- Limited the number of visible filters to avoid overwhelming riders in short attention windows.

## Outcomes
- Interaction flow map for the discovery experience.
- UI wireframes for key discovery states.
- Interactive prototype demonstrating the discovery flow.

## Learnings
- In this project, shorter, more stable interactions felt better suited to transit contexts.
- In this work, a clearer information hierarchy reduced perceived cognitive load when attention was fragmented.
- Small filter sets can improve relevance without adding complexity.
- Constraining scope to discovery improves clarity and reduces decision fatigue.
