# Principle
- I am motivated by design work that makes systems feel clear and usable to the people relying on them.
- I prefer approaches that keep product decisions grounded in how people actually navigate a task.

## Rationale
- Clarity reduces the cost of getting started and lowers the chance of users missing what matters.
- Grounding decisions in real usage keeps the work tied to concrete needs rather than abstract goals.

## Tensions
- Convenience can conflict with transparency when simplifying complex systems.
- Speed of iteration can conflict with the care needed to preserve intent.

## Application
- I try to test whether a design choice helps someone understand what to do next without extra explanation.
- I look for places where system complexity can be surfaced without overwhelming the user.
