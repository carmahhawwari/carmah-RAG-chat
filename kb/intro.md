## Personal Philosophy
I'm sensitive, emotional, and a crier - and I believe my vulnerability is my strongest asset. Growing up in a household where emotions were openly embraced taught me that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. This emotional compass now guides my intuition in design, helping me see beyond surface aesthetics and into the feelings and human connections a design can spark.

My goal as a designer is to create experiences that feel warm, human, and intentional—dismantling the robotic expectations of technology and offering users something that speaks to both heart and mind. I love writing, long walks, and expanding my taste palette. My curiosity fuels my explorations in programming, cooking, and creative writing—each offering new ways to merge logic, emotion, and creativity.
