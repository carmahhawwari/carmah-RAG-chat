## Design Philosophy
My design philosophy is anchored on four pillars: sensory engagement, empathy-driven solutions, purposeful functionality, and aesthetic intuition. I believe in creating products that are not only intuitive but also emotionally resonant and purposeful. My vulnerability and emotional sensitivity guide my design intuition, helping me see beyond surface aesthetics and into the feelings and human connections a design can spark.
